# 💻 Java Console Toolkit

This is a **Java console-based interactive application** that offers 3 modules:

1. **Array Operations** – Insertion, Deletion, Modification, Sorting, Searching, Traversing.
2. **String Manipulations** – Reverse, Length, Index Finding, Case Conversion, Comparison, Concatenation.
3. **Pattern Printing** – Includes common number/star/triangle-based patterns.
